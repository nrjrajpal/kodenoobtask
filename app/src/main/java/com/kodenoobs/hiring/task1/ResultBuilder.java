     *   We need to implement this result builder which takes list of candidates and then generates the result
     *   Input Details:
     *       1. This function accepts a list of students.
     *           - each of student has list of results.
     *           - Each result specify Name of the Subject and Score.
     *
     *   We need to compute following:
     *
     *   1. Maximum Score for Each subject.
     *   2. Minimum Score for each subject.
     *   3. Average score for each subject.
     *   4. List of Passed Students.
     *   5. List of failed Students.
     *
     *
     *  NOTE: A student is passed if they have scored more than 39 in each of the subjects.
     *       e.g:
     *           Student 1 has results [ "Subject 1" ->  55, "Subject 2" -> 40, "Subject 3" ->  95 ] then student is passed
     *           Student 2 has results [ "Subject 1" ->  55, "Subject 2" -> 39, "Subject 3" ->  95 ] then student is failed
     *
     *  Validation:
     *   You should be able to pass ResultBuilderTest
